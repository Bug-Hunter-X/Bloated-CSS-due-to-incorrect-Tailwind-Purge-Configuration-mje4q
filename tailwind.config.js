The issue lies in the Tailwind CSS configuration.  The `purge` option, used to remove unused CSS, is either missing or misconfigured. This leads to all the CSS being included in the build, even if some styles are never used in the project.  This often leads to bloated CSS file size and slower load times.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect or missing purge configuration in tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [], // Should be an array of paths to your templates or components
  // ...rest of config
}
```
